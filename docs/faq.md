## Is it possible to convert from Yjs e.g. to Automerge?

Naisho does not provide any conversion functionality. Even if you have the raw changes/updates from one library and apply them in the other the outcome would be different, because they are based on different algorithms.

A lossy conversion is probably possible but not in scope for this project.
